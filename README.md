Building (and testing) Boost for Windows (and testing Linux)
----------

There are three main parts to this repository
* BoostBuilding - Scripts and tools to build boost for MSVC (MicroSoft Visual C++)
* BoostLibraryCheck - Some *very* simple projects to check that libraries built for MSVC link and execute.
* Regression - Configurations for all the machines I run regression tests on.
